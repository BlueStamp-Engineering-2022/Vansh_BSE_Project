# Mask/Social Distancing Detection Construct
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
While getting information from the ultrasonic sensor, if the ultrasonic sensor detects someone without a mask that is less than 200 centimeters away, then I wrote a program for the raspberry pi to login into the server and send an email to me. This email warns me that I have come into contact with someone who wasn't following safe COVID-19 protocols. In this project, I struggled on getting the email to work because of gmail restrictions. After it worked, I had a wave of relief because I had spent a lot of time on this. I'm happy with my project and I plan to get more RAM to train my own model that works better.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is I trained a cascade model to detect a mouth. I took videos of people and cropped the video to show just the mouth. I then wrote a python program to take each frame of the video and save it as a JPG file. This images are used to train the model. I ran into an error where the images were taking up too much storage. This was because I recorded the videos in 4K. I changed the resolution to SD and split up the videos again so that the images would be a lower resolution. This fixed the storage problem. I also connect an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between someone and the location of the sensor. This will be part of the "Social Distancing" section of this project. I programmed the ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance and return it.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor. The PiCamera2, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. I downloaded everything using an Imager. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi 4's OS. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The software was on the SD card and I put into into my Raspberry Pi. I hooked up my Raspberry Pi to a monitor, a mouse and keyboard, and I attached a camera to it that works. I finished programming and configuring the camera to work in my program. I plan to add a few more features and find a way to combine the camera with OpenCV, which I plan on using for my code.
