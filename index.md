# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor. The PiCamera2, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. I downloaded everything using an Imager. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi 4's OS. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The software was on the SD card and I put into into my Raspberry Pi. I hooked up my Raspberry Pi to a monitor, a mouse and keyboard, and I attached a camera to it that works. I finished programming and configuring the camera to work in my program. I plan to add a few more features and find a way to combine the camera with OpenCV, which I plan on using for my code.
